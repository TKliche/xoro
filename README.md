# xoro

This is the picorv32 RISC-V processor in Verilog wrapped in some very simple
memory and peripherals. Enough to get it working on a Terasic DE-0 Nano
Cyclone IV FPGA board.

The name comes from the fact that this project grew out of a version of the
xoroshiro128+ pseudo random number generator in Verilog.
